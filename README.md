*The elderly do not have an active lifestyle, with no stimulant cognitive and/or physical activities. Our app will improve their lifestyle with games and ways to contact their family.*

## *An ever-increasing problem*

Insufficient physical and cognitives activies are a major problem that affects the elderly. This problem is aggravated by social isolation.
According to Guarda Nacional Republicana (GNR), there are 45.563 elderly living alone in Portugal ([source](https://www.noticiasaominuto.com/pais/1175994/mais-de-45-mil-idosos-vivem-sozinhos-isolados-ou-em-situacao-vulneravel)).

These people suffer from the negative effects of social exclusion and usually shut themselves off.

## *Our answer to this threat*

+ativa is an intuitive app that offers two main features:
- Stimulant cognitive activities, such as games.
- Basic image and voice sharing chat with family.

## *A cheaper alternative*

Our app only needs a smartphone and is intuitive enough so that the elderly can easily get the gist of it.
