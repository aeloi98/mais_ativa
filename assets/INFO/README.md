## Population aging has led to an increase in the prevalence of dementia

Dementia is the loss of cognitive functioning—thinking, remembering, and reasoning—and behavioral abilities to such an extent that it interferes with a person's daily life and activities.

* Memory
* Languages SKills
* Visual Perception
* Problem Solving 
* Self-Managment
* Ability to focus and pay attention

Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST)

This study conducted by SOMEONE showed that cognitive stimulation therapy increase by 16% the cognition on nursing home elders. However there were no statistically significant differences in depressive symptoms.

The guiding principles of CST involved:
* using new ideas, thoughts and associations
* using orientation (both sensitively and implicitly)
* a focus on opinions rather than facts
* using reminiscence as an aid to the here and now
* providing triggers to aid recall
* creation of continuity and consistency betweensessions
* focus on implicit (rather than explicit) learning
* stimulating language
* stimulating executive functioning being personcentered

Cognitive Stimulation in Elderly People

The aging process can be accompanied by a decline in both
physical and cognitive skills.

The maintenance of cognitive health is of vital importance in the quality of life and well-being of older
people.

Aging affects cognitive functions on elder people as the brain changes.

Several studies have provided statistical evidence that cognitive stimulation helps to improve the cognitive function of elders with or without cognitive impairment

**Loneliness and social isolation are important health risks in the elderly**
